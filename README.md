# Stock_Analysis
VBA Stock analysis project Module 2

# Overview of Project
An analysis of the performance of a variety of stocks was performed at the request of client, Steve. After an original analysis of a pre-selected list of stocks, Steve also requested an updated code that would be able to run efficiently over data from the stock market at large. In order to meet this request, the original analysis code was refactored to reduce run time.
